### Price

- **Now** (qui si può pensare se esporre una websoket o SSE)

I prossimi 3 punti sono dati che le aziende quotate devono fornire trimestralmente.
Di questi punti servirebbe la history per quarter e per anno.
Immagino che i provider di dati forniscano tutto quello che segue in un'unica API.
